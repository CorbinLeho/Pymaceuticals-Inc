Of these three drugs, Capomulin was the only one to reduce the
size of the tumors, and slow down the spread of metastatic sites.

Ketapril looks to be causing more harm than good as compared to
the placebo. It starts to trend worse towards the end of the 
trials.

Infubinol was not very effective when compared to the placebo in 
survival or reduceing the size of tumors. However, it does appear 
to reduce the spread of metastatic sites.
